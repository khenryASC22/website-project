        <p>My Name is Kingston Henry. I'm from Maryland and I'm 15. When I was 5 my parents took me to school everyday for the next 10 years so I have them to thank for always making it on time. When I go on vacation I like to go to either Jamacia or Canada. I am a aspiring coder and want to learn more coding languages. What I enjoy to do in my free time is play video games or watch tiktok. My favorite video games are Roblox, Cod, and Valorant </p>
